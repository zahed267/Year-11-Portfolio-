<h1>Low Poly character</h1> 
A Low Poly Character is a small 3D model that can produce animations and other movement. I will be using a app called Blender which allows us to do all the magic. For my Low Poly Character will be have a circular head, a long upper half , the legs will be strong and long  for my animation which is a knee slide.   
</div>

<h1>Design considerations</h1>
The end users of my project would be targeted for people who enjoy football, becuase of the knee slide animation and how my design of my character will be slightly realated to football. The reqirements of my characters will be to have strong legs especially the knees due to the animation, it must have a torso, body, head, and arms.


<h1>Relevant Implications</h1>
Aesthetics: Aesthetics considerations are the way that my character visually overall. This is important because how my character will portray my theme or game and how it will look like. visually, and will it be connected to the game or theme?
<br>
<br>
Functionality: Functionality ensures that the character works properly within the game. This is important because with my animation for my Low Poly character is a knee slide. And that has a lot of movement invloved and the knee slide is a celebration in football which is my theme.
<br>
<br>
Usability: Usability affects hoe easliy players can understand and interact with my character. This is important because if the character isn't usable and it cant function at all the end users won't be happy and it would be a fail. 
<br>
<br>
Intellectual Property: Intellectual property protects original idea from being copied. It's important because no one can use your idea or design from being copied to other games, it can also be copyright becuase you don't own the idea and it isn't yours.
